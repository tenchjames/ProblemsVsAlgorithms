This problem seemed too easy and I am actually questioning if some other way to
approach this problem was expected. To find the min and max at the same time in 
n time I just keep two variables and change their value when a new min or max
is found. No need to sort.

Time complexity

O(n) is the overall time complexity. I look over the input array only one time.
Each step of the look is constant time. 


Space complexity

O(1) because no additional storage or data structures were needed to complete
the algorithm
